The Water Quality Manager is built on CommCare HQ, available at: http://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq

This work was supported by the Aquatest Research Program: an international multidisciplinary consortium focused on
developing appropriate water quality diagnostics and data management tools that is led by the University of Bristol
in the UK and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the University of Cape Town, the members of the research team and
post-graduate students, and specifically the following UCT team members: Michael Champanis, Melissa Loudon, and
Ulrike Rivett.

Many thanks to the Dimagi team and all of the project contributors.
